# Learn-Python

My Python Learning Process.

This repository reflects my journey through a Udemy course that covers Python from beginner to advanced levels, supplemented with knowledge from various sources. My goal is to provide all the necessary information to learn Python sequentially, so you can gain a complete understanding by following the files in order, without needing an additional guide. Please note that the course on which this repository is based is no longer open for enrollment: https://www.udemy.com/course/python-tutorial-for-beginners/
