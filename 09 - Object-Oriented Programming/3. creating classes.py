# Creating a class
class Country:

# Creating objects of the Country() class
italy = Country()
usa = Country()
netherlands = Country()

# Creating attributes
italy.name = "Italy"
italy.capital = "Rome"

usa.name = "USA"
usa.capital = "Washington"

netherlands.name = "Netherlands"
netherlands.capital = "Amsterdam"

# Printing objects' state
print(italy.capital)     # Rome
print(netherlands.name)  # Netherlands

# In a class, each object has its own instances (attributes) of the data (state).
