# PEP 20: The Zen of Python
# Learn the guiding principles of Python with PEP 20.
# This can be accessed directly from a Python console with:
import this

# There are additional tools to help with PEP guidelines:

# flake8: Checks Python code for PEP 8 compliance.
# pylint: Analyzes code for errors and coding standards, providing a total score.
# black: Automatically formats code according to PEP guidelines.

# To install these tools, use:
# pip install flake8 pylint black

# Usage:
# Open a terminal (not the Python console) and run:

# 'flake8 path_to_folder' - to analyze multiple scripts (including subfolders)
# 'flake8 path_to_script' - to analyze a single file

# 'pylint path_to_folder' - to analyze multiple scripts (including subfolders)
# 'pylint path_to_script' - to analyze a single file

# 'black path_to_folder' - to format multiple scripts (including subfolders)
# 'black path_to_script' - to format a single file

# Note: This GitHub repo contains mainly .py files for documentation purposes, so the analysis scores may be lower
# because they are not meant to be complete, functional Python scripts.
